# Lab 05 OpenAI APIs (EdenAI)

Today's lab will be **directly evaluated** by teaching assistants, so **only a 100-point version** will be available, **not a 60-point version**.

We will utilize EdenAI as an example to demonstrate how to leverage existing AI generation providers and their APIs to meet requirements and retrieve generated content. (Alternatively, you may explore other APIs capable of producing images from text, but **you will be responsible for covering the associated costs**.)

# Description

EdenAI collaborates with various providers for image generation, each offering different pricing structures.

Given the **quota of only one US dollar**, it is advisable to select a provider with **lower costs (e.g., Replicate)**.
